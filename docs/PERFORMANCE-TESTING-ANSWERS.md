# Performance Testing Interview Answers

## Question: How would you execute these types of tests?

### 1. **Load Testing** (Normal Peak Load)

**What it is:** Simulating expected user traffic during peak hours.

**K6 Implementation:**
```javascript
stages: [
  { duration: '30s', target: 3 },   // Gradual ramp-up
  { duration: '1m', target: 5 },    // Stay at peak (using low numbers for demo)
  { duration: '30s', target: 0 },   // Graceful shutdown
]
```

**How I'd execute:**
- Run in staging environment that mirrors production
- Use realistic user scenarios (browse, search, view pages)
- Monitor key metrics: response time, error rate, throughput
- Establish baseline for normal operations

### 2. **Stress Testing** (Pushing Until Failure)

**What it is:** Gradually increasing load to find breaking points.

**K6 Implementation:**
```javascript
stages: [
  { duration: '30s', target: 5 },    // Normal load
  { duration: '1m', target: 10 },    // Above normal
  { duration: '1m', target: 15 },    // Push further
  { duration: '30s', target: 0 },    // Recovery
]
```

**How I'd execute:**
- Start with known good load
- Incrementally increase users
- Monitor for first signs of degradation
- Identify bottlenecks (CPU, memory, database)
- Document failure points and recovery time

### 3. **Spike Testing** (Sudden Large Load)

**What it is:** Simulating sudden traffic surges (viral content, marketing campaigns).

**K6 Implementation:**
```javascript
stages: [
  { duration: '30s', target: 2 },    // Normal traffic
  { duration: '10s', target: 10 },   // Sudden spike!
  { duration: '30s', target: 10 },   // Sustained spike
  { duration: '10s', target: 2 },    // Quick drop
  { duration: '30s', target: 0 },
]
```

**How I'd execute:**
- Simulate flash sale or viral event scenario
- Monitor auto-scaling response
- Check for data consistency during spike
- Verify graceful degradation if needed
- Test recovery to normal state

### 4. **Soak Testing** (Long-Duration)

**What it is:** Extended testing to find memory leaks and performance degradation.

**K6 Implementation:**
```javascript
stages: [
  { duration: '30s', target: 3 },    // Ramp up
  { duration: '5m', target: 3 },     // Sustained (normally 8-24 hours)
  { duration: '30s', target: 0 },
]
```

**How I'd execute:**
- Run for extended periods (8-24 hours typically)
- Monitor memory usage trends
- Check for connection pool exhaustion
- Look for gradual performance degradation
- Verify log file rotation and cleanup

### 5. **Scalability Testing** (Growth with Load)

**What it is:** Testing how well the system scales with increasing load.

**K6 Implementation:**
```javascript
stages: [
  { duration: '1m', target: 2 },     // Baseline
  { duration: '1m', target: 4 },     // 2x load
  { duration: '1m', target: 6 },     // 3x load
  { duration: '1m', target: 8 },     // 4x load
  { duration: '30s', target: 0 },
]
```

**How I'd execute:**
- Measure performance at each level
- Calculate cost per transaction
- Identify linear vs exponential scaling
- Find optimal scaling points
- Test both vertical and horizontal scaling

## Production Testing Strategy

### Safety Measures:
1. **Use minimal load** (1-10 users max)
2. **Run during off-peak hours**
3. **Have rollback plan ready**
4. **Monitor in real-time**
5. **Coordinate with ops team**

### Alternative Approaches:
1. **Shadow Testing:** Mirror production traffic to staging
2. **Canary Testing:** Test small percentage of real traffic
3. **Feature Flags:** Test specific features in isolation
4. **Synthetic Monitoring:** Continuous small-scale tests

### Key Metrics to Track:
- **Response Time:** p50, p95, p99 percentiles
- **Error Rate:** HTTP errors, timeouts, failures
- **Throughput:** Requests per second
- **Concurrency:** Active connections
- **Resource Usage:** CPU, memory, network, disk I/O

### Integration with CI/CD:
```yaml
performance-gate:
  - Compare against baseline
  - Fail build if degradation > 10%
  - Generate trend reports
  - Alert on anomalies
```

## Sample Answer for Interview:

"I would approach performance testing with a progressive strategy. Starting with load testing to establish baselines during normal operations, using very conservative numbers like 5-10 virtual users for production safety.

For stress testing, I'd use a staging environment that mirrors production, gradually increasing load to identify breaking points and bottlenecks. This helps with capacity planning.

Spike testing is crucial for e-commerce or content platforms that might experience sudden traffic surges. I'd simulate these scenarios with rapid ramp-ups, monitoring how quickly the system scales and recovers.

Soak testing would run overnight or over weekends, maintaining steady load to catch memory leaks or resource exhaustion that only appear over time.

For scalability testing, I'd work with the DevOps team to test both vertical scaling (bigger servers) and horizontal scaling (more servers), measuring the cost-effectiveness of each approach.

All of this would be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline with automated performance gates, ensuring no deployment degrades performance beyond acceptable thresholds."
